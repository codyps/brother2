brother2
========

This driver was initially designed based on network dumps from wireshark of the
windows driver comunicating with a MFC-7820N multifunction printer/scanner/fax.

Because Brother has a single driver ("brscan2", in the case of the MFC-7820N)
for a number of devices, I expect that other devices which use the same Brother
Proprietary driver ("brscan2") may work with this driver.

For a listing of models, see the [Scanner driver download] link below.

Building
--------
Use `make`.

Project contains two (2) components:

  libsane-bro2.so ::  a sane scanner driver.

  bro2-serv :: a server which pretends to be a mfc-7820n. Requires libev.


Testing
-------

    ./bro2-serv

    # This works in gentoo. on arch, the /usr/lib/libsane.so.1 (libsane-dll)
    # gets loaded first due to RPATH in /usr/bin/scanadf (the gentoo version
    # lacks the rpath entry)
    # Built with undefined SANE_DLL
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. scanadf -d bro2:127.0.0.1

    # For libsane-dll, a dll.d directory with a single config file is created,
    # containing the word "bro2". This causes libsane-dll to attempt to load
    # Right now this fails because the major version is 0 instead of 1.
    SANE_DEBUG_DLL=255 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. scanadf -L

Or, more idealy, use a real scanner instead of the fake one.
