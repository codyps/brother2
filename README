brother2
========

This driver was initially designed based on network dumps from wireshark of the
windows driver comunicating with a MFC-7820N multifunction printer/scanner/fax.

Because Brother has a single driver ("brscan2", in the case of the MFC-7820N)
for a number of devices, I expect that other devices which use the same Brother
Proprietary driver ("brscan2") may work with this driver.

For a listing of models, see the [Scanner driver download] link below.

Building
--------
Use `make`.

Project contains two (2) components:

  libsane-bro2.so ::  a sane scanner driver.

  bro2-serv :: a server which pretends to be a mfc-7820n. Requires libev.


Testing
-------

    ./bro2-serv

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. scanadf -d bro2:127.0.0.1

Or, more idealy, use a real scanner instead of the fake one.
